# hue-visualizer
An application to visualize the Philips Hue activity for retards, which goes to the moon ðŸš€
It's maybe more a Philips Hue usage visualization.

## Project motivation
I control all my smart home devices with my pretty awesome white-blue Philips Hue via Alexa and enjoy all advantages. But everything i'm able to control or see is the actual snapshot about which device is turned on or off. This Project, how ever it will be implemented and whatever it contains, collects all data to visualize the usage over any period of time. It may could help to improve to reduce the energy consumption by turning off and on the plugs automatically.

# Technical stuff

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

And https://github.com/ZeroOne3010/yetanotherhueapi as Philips Hue API

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./gradlew quarkusDev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./gradlew build
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `build/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that itâ€™s not an _Ã¼ber-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `build/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

If you want to build an _Ã¼ber-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application is now runnable using `java -jar build/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./build/hue-visualizer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/gradle-tooling.
